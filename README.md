How do the UN Sustainable Development Goals compare for Australia & New Zealand?
We take you through an interacive story told in numbers with the help of Python, Tableau and Web Development. The aim of this project is to compare & draw insights from the chosen few sustainable development goals (SDG) for both counties â€“ Australia and New Zealand.

This report was submitted as part of our Data Visualization course with Professor Jaime De Mora Navarro during our Master in Business Analytics and Big Data at IE Business School. Please feel welcome to share your opinion on the story with us.

## 1. Downlaid data from World Banks
We need to get data first. In our case the project focused on the UN SDGs for Australia and New Zealand.

## 2. Clean data on Python
Tableau is a great tool for data visualization, but to prepare the data Python works better. Make sure you have all the features/columns you would like to display in you visualizations and even create new ones if necessary.

## 3. Use the clean data set for visualizations with Tableau
We used the Tableau Desktop version to create our visualization before we pushed them to the public server. You will need to seperate accounts for that, one for Tableau Desktop and one for Tableau Public. 

## 4. Create a basic website
For people with little knowlegde of web development this may be the trickiest step. However, there are great website templates out there which can then be customized.  

## 5. Log in on Tableau Public to get the HTML code
On Tableau Public get the code to implement your visualization in your website's HTML code.

## 6. Upload files to GitHub and activate GitHub Pages
You can host your website on GitHub. Simply push all your HTML, CSS and JS files to a new repository. Keep it public and activate GitHub Pages in the settings. Link it to your main branch and wait a few minutes. With the generated link you should see your dynamic report as a website. :)
