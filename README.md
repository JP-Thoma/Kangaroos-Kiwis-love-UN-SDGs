How do the UN Sustainable Development Goals compare for Australia & New Zealand?
We take you through an interacive story told in numbers with the help of Python, Tableau and Web Development. The aim of this project is to compare & draw insights from the chosen few sustainable development goals (SDG) for both counties â€“ Australia and New Zealand.

This report was submitted as part of our Data Visualization course with Professor Jaime De Mora Navarro during our Master in Business Analytics and Big Data at IE Business School. Please feel welcome to share your opinion on the story with us.
